Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes as given below:\n\n**Label \tDescription** <br>\n0 \tT-shirt/top <br>\n1 \tTrouser <br>\n2 \tPullover <br>\n3 \tDress <br>\n4 \tCoat <br>\n5 \tSandal <br>\n6 \tShirt <br>\n7 \tSneaker <br>\n8 \tBag <br>\n9 \tAnkle boot <br>\n\n**Points to be Noted**\n1. Each image is of size 28x28 = 784 pixels.\n2. Grayscale images have a total of 255 shades/pixels ranges from 0 to 255 to define how much dark or light that pixel will be. 0 = Maximum Dark; 255 = Maximum White.\n3. Each row is a separate image and column as labels (0-9).\n3. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used for dealing with images (computer vision) and increases the accuracy of model a lot even > 99% by finding the edges in the image"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Model run with TensorFlow 2.0\n# !pip install -U tensorflow==2.0.0-beta1  # to install tensorflow 2.0-beta1 in Kaggle notebook\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nprint(tf.__version__)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Training & Test Data and Normalize it"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load Fashion MNIST Data\nmnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist\n(x_train_images, y_train_labels), (x_test_images, y_test_labels) = mnist.load_data()\nprint(x_train_images.shape)\nprint(y_train_labels.shape)\n# Convert the image into a 4D list\nx_train_images = x_train_images.reshape(60000, 28, 28, 1)  # last 1 indicates that its a gray scale image\nprint(x_train_images.shape)\nx_train_images = x_train_images / 255.0  # Normalize images into values ranging from 0 to 1\nx_test_images = x_test_images.reshape(10000, 28, 28, 1)\nx_test_images = x_test_images/255.0     # Normalize images into values ranging from 0 to 1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Define, Compile and Run the Model\n**Conv2d:** Used to find edges and filter out important information from th image.

This is because when applying a 3x3 filter. It requires adjacent pixels on all 4 directions (left,right,up,down). But since when the filter is convolved at the uppermost, lowermost, leftmost and rightmost pixels, there is no adjacent pixels. Therefore, it decreases the size by 2 from each size resulting in 26x26 image size.
